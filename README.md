# HashTable.java
HashTable stores INT values with its row and file details as metadata.
Initial size of HashTable can be set default is 12 but it increases as more values are inputed to HashTable.
HashTable can also do 3 different operations UNION, OR AND XOR.
Values from these operations are returned as LinkedLists.

# Test.java
Test.java reads two text files and inputs first INT on every row to HashTable.
